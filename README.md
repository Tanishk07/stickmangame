﻿Stickman Game
AP Project | Readme File
Overview
This is a Stickman game implemented in Java using JavaFX. The game involves a Stickman character navigating through a series of towers by extending and retracting sticks. The player's goal is to reach the end of each tower while collecting cherries for points and avoiding obstacles like bees.
Features
* Character Selection: The game allows the player to choose between different Stickman characters with different animations.
* Difficulty Levels: The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, which affect the appearance of towers.
* Obstacles: Bees and cherries act as obstacles and rewards, impacting the player's score and health.
* Scoring: Players earn points by successfully extending sticks to reach the next tower. Collecting cherries provides additional points.
* Health System: The game features a health system represented by heart icons. Colliding with obstacles decreases health, and the game ends if health reaches zero.
* Resume Functionality: Players can resume the game after pausing or exiting.

Development
* JavaFX: The game is developed using JavaFX for GUI and animation.
* Object-Oriented Design: The code follows an object-oriented design, with classes for Stickman characters, towers, obstacles, and game elements.
* Game State Management: The game saves and loads player progress, allowing for resuming after pausing or exiting.
Dependencies
* Java 8 or later
* JavaFX library
How to Run
* Compile and run the Java code in an IDE or using the command line.
* Ensure the JavaFX library is correctly set up in the project.
Design Pattern Used
* Singleton Design Pattern: The Singleton Design Pattern is employed to ensure that certain classes have only one instance, providing a global point of access to that instance.
* Facade Design Pattern:The Facade Design Pattern is utilized to simplify the interaction between the game components and provide a unified interface to the player.


Future Improvements
* Additional levels and challenges.
* Sound effects and music.
* High score tracking.
